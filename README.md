# Credit scoring and segementation analysis

* **Objective:** The notebook appears to evaluate customer credit scores and segment customers based on their creditworthiness using Python.

**Key Sections:** 
* **Data Loading:** The notebook begins with importing necessary libraries (such as pandas, plotly, and scikit-learn), and data preprocessing steps for handling customer data.
* **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** There's analysis of the customer credit data, including visualizations that highlight trends or insights related to customer segments and their credit scores.
* **Segmentation:** Using techniques like KMeans clustering, the notebook segments customers into distinct groups based on their credit profiles.
* **Visualization**: It includes visualizations (e.g., scatter plots) generated using Plotly, displaying how different customer segments are distributed based on credit scores.
* **Summary:** It concludes with a summary of the insights and results from the segmentation
